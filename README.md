This is a project which I am using to test all of my skills learned in the Makers Databases module. It will include test driving a full shop manager project where the user will be able to list and create items and orders.

TO RUN:

1. Create pipenv
2. Install dependencies (if not using pipenv)
3. Run `python3 app.py` in the terminal
